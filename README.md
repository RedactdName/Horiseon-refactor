# week1-refactor-seo
Week 1 Challenge

## Description

This project took some provided code and refactored it to allow for better accessability and demonstrate the benefit to semantic HTML use while unchanging the webpage visually. This was done as a learning technique to practice undertanding how to structure HTML semantically, why it is better to use a semantic structure and how quickly things can change depending on how the code is written. It provided reflection on best practices when beginning to code. 

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
