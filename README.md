# week1-refactor-seo
Week 1 Challenge

## Description

This project took some provided code that required refactoring for better accessability and demonstrate the benefit to semantic HTML use while unchanging the UI. This was done as a learning technique to practice undertanding how to structure HTML semantically, why it is better to use a semantic structure and how quickly things can change depending on how the code is written. It provided reflection on best practices when beginning to code. 

## Installation
To compare the changes made from the original code you will need access to GitLab DU-VIRT-FSF-PT-06-2023-U-LOLC/01-HTML-Git-CSS/02-Challenge/Develop/index.html to view the original. Once accessed, the index.html provided in this repo holds the semantic html code. 

## Usage

The usage for this is purely educational to practice by doing and demonstrate an understanding of proper coding techniques.
